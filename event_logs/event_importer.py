In this code, we first read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and convert the 'timestamp' column to datetime format. We then set the 'timestamp' column as the index of the DataFrame, which will allow us to easily filter the DataFrame based on the start and end times.

Next, we define the start and end times as datetime objects and use them to filter the DataFrame to include only events between those times. We then group the filtered DataFrame by hour using the pd.Grouper function with a frequency of '1H', and count the number of events in each hour using the size() function.

Finally, we print the resulting event counts. Note that the output will be a Pandas Series with a datetime index, where each value represents the number of events that occurred in the corresponding hour.
